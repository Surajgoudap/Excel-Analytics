## major concepts I learnt:
*ETL: Extract, Transform, Load.
-it refers to the process of extracting data from various sources
-transforming the data to fit the desired data model or format
-loading the data into a target data store or destination

*Power Query: transform and connects data from different sources, such as databases and spreadsheets, into a format suitable for analysis.

*Data cleaning in power query: involves the process of identifying and correcting inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors in data ensure that it accurate and usable for analysis and reporting.

*Data modelling: involves the process of connecting different datasets together by establishing the relationship between them.
-star schema: is a data modelling technique that arranges data into a central fact table, surrounded by several dimension tables.

*Power pivot: it allows users to create relationships between tables and perform advanced calculations with large amounts of data.

*DAX functions:
FORMAT(), MONTH(), ROUNDUP(), CALCULATE(), SUMX().many more....
